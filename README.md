Virtual Pet Environment – Mini Project
Course: Database Management Systems (DBMS)
Institution: RV University
Semester: 2nd Semester

📌 Project Overview
This mini project was developed as part of our DBMS course. The objective was to design and implement a full-stack web application integrating:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Backend: Node.js and Express.js

Database: MySQL

The chosen theme, Virtual Pet Environment, provides a playful yet challenging concept, allowing users to interact with and care for virtual pets. This topic was selected for its uniqueness and creativity, making it stand out from typical project ideas.

🛠️ Development Phases
Phase 1: Database Design
Designed and implemented a normalized MySQL database consisting of 7 interrelated tables, covering aspects of both users and their pets.

Inserted sample data to simulate real-world interactions and perform initial testing.

Phase 2: Full Stack Integration
Connected the frontend interface with backend logic using Express.js.

Ensured real-time interaction with the database, allowing user actions on the frontend to dynamically reflect in the backend and database.

Focused on data integrity, consistency, and error handling.

Phase 3: Feedback and Iteration
Collected and implemented constructive feedback from peers and instructors.

Enhanced UI/UX design for improved usability and visual appeal.

Refined backend logic and database schema to better align with project goals and use cases.

💡 Learning Outcomes
This project was an excellent opportunity to:

Apply web development skills from our Web Fundamentals (Semester 1) course.

Implement relational database design and server integration concepts from the DBMS (Semester 2) course.

Gain hands-on experience in full-stack development using industry-standard tools and practices.

Understand the importance of iterative development and user-centered design.
